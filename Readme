#1.Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks
#About the Data:
          "The dataset we'll be using is the Multi30k dataset. This is a dataset with ~30,000 parallel English, German and French sentences, each with ~12 words per sentence"
          
#Step by Step Implementation:
           1.Imports
           2.Data Preprocessing using torchtext
           3.Seq2Seq Model Building
           4.Assigning Parameters, loss function , optimizers
           5.Define Training loop:
           6.Define Evaluation loop:
           7.Training the Model
