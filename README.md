#1. In this particular Repository, Multi30K dataset is fed and German source and English target is selected for the translation.The project utilized heavy Pytorch concepts.

#2. And the dataset is fed into variety of RNN customized units and checked for its loss and perplexity.

#3.The various Seq2Seq RNN models are used in the repository:
                                1.Seq2Seq NN without Attention but with 2 layer LSTM
                                2.Gated Recurrent Unit 

#4.Aim of the repository is to have ultimate and optimal model which is best for Machine translation.

#Inspiration and Idea to the code generation is given by Mr.Ben Trevett (UK) and Mr.Aladdin Pearson, Youtuber.
